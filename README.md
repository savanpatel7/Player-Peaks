# Player-Peaks
Examining footballers' peak ages and ages of improvement/decline based on data from the European Big 5

Looking to replicate findings? Do so in this order:
1. obtain the data using the 'data' folder (running each .py)
2. run merging_and_positions.py in the 'wrangling' folder
3. use each of the notebooks in 'analysis and plotting' to obtain plots for each position
